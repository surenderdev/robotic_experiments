## Summary

#### 1.	Set up Simulation Environment:

Configure PyBullet and load simulation objects 

#### 2.	Perform Object Detection:

Utilize YOLO to detect and annotate objects (robot, bench, ball) in the simulated environment.

#### 3.	Move Desired Object to Target Position:
Move specified object (ball) to the defined target position (on top of bench).

#### 4.	Capture journey:
Capture the movement from beginning to end as a video file.

----------
### Step 1: Setup YOLO, PyBullet, Visual Shape, Robot Base, and Video Writer
Connect to PyBullet: Connect to PyBullet and set initial conditions.
Initialize the object detection model with predefined classes. 
Configure Video Writer: Set up the video writer to save needed frames in an MP4 file.
Capture and save the initial scene setting as an image.
### Step 2: Object Detection
Defined a function to detect objects using YOLO and annotate the detected objects in the scene. Today, we may deal with a kitchen scenario; tomorrow, it might be an office or sports scenario. Hence YOLO-World is chosen as the base model to ensure flexibility and avoid dependence on specific training data and models each time.
### Step 3: Move Object
Defined a function to move a specified object (ball) to a target position (top of bench), capturing frames along the way.
### Stability while moving:
I have noticed even a small movement in the scene is making entire scene unstable with all objects (ball, robot and bench) flying away; taking off away from the scene. To prevent this from happening, many steps were taken. 
The ball's movement is broken into four distinct phases: lifting vertically, moving horizontally, lowering to the target, and allowing moved object to settle. This step-by-step approach ensured smooth and controlled movements.
 ##### Phase 1: Lift Vertically: The ball is lifted vertically to avoid collisions. 
 ##### Phase 2: Move Horizontally: The ball is moved horizontally while maintaining a consistent height to avoid unintentional contact with other objects.
##### Phase 3: Lower to Target: The ball is lowered to the target position gently to prevent it from bouncing upon reaching the target height.
##### Phase 4: Allow Settling: Additional simulation steps are run to allow the ball to settle and ensure there is stability in the final position of object placement.
